Portable bundles.
It should be possible to bundle an application into a single POSIX shell file that can then be run on any UNIX operating system. The idea is to include multiple heredocs, each one of which is
a kernel binary precompiled for the OS/architecture in question. The shell script can detect the configuration, write the binary to /tmp, chmod +x it, and then run it.
