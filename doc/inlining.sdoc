Trace inlining.
Naive CPS conversion produces a lot of overhead, and it quickly becomes important to eliminate some of the generality by linking trace sets together. This can be done using traditional tracing
JIT techniques; each block tracks its return continuations and those with monomorphic or small polymorphic continuation sets are then hard-compiled (provided that there's a good reason to do
this -- i.e. the blocks are frequently run).
