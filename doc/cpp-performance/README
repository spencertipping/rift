This directory contains C++ programs and corresponding assembly files. I use it
to determine the ideal compilation cases for various kinds of programs.

Depending on what you're looking for, it may be useful to use Radare or some
other disassembler on the final linked executables.

To use these examples, see the 'build' and 'run' scripts. 'build' rebuilds all
of the examples (sorry, no timestamp dependencies yet), and 'run' runs a
specific one at all optimization levels. For example:

$ ./build
$ ./run no-virtuals
-O0:
time time time time
-O1:
time time time time
-O2:
time time time time
$
