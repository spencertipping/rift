JVM interoperability.
It should be possible to leverage the Java standard library. This eliminates a lot of platform-specific library maintenance. Probably the best way to do this is to generate proxy .class files
and load them into a JVM constructed with the Java Invocation API. This would enable the JVM to be used for platform-specific stuff, but maintain good continuation performance. The only
particular restriction is that Java classes would have to be continuation-transparent.
