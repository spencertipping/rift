Lexical context compression.
Jeffrey Siskind's Stalin compiler compresses what it refers to as 'fictitious' variables, and then compresses lexical contexts to minimize the amount of memory that needs to be allocated when
a closure is created. It often ends up erasing closures completely by means that I'm on my way to understanding.

Rift can do something similar since contexts are immutable. Most closures are used in conjunction with virtual methods, so static escape analysis isn't feasible. However, we can detect
escaping later on and mark methods as having or not having this side effect. (By definition, side-effect-free methods cannot cause values to escape.)
