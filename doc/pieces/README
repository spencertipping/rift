These are various assembly-level prototype implementations intended for
reference purposes. I use them to test various ideas and make low-level
decisions.

Note that these examples are deliberately unoptimized. There are many low-level
optimizations that would normally be made to assembly code; these are discussed
further in the implementation source.
