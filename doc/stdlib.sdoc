Standard library design.
Rift's standard library differs fairly significantly from Ruby's, but not in ways that break much stuff. This file covers some of these design choices.

Subclassing Class.
The Class class can now be subclassed, and this is done a lot in Rift's standard library. There are several places where this is used:

| 1. Singleton classes are instances of SingletonClass, which is a subclass of Class. SingletonClasses can't be subclassed.
  2. Many VM-internal classes are instances of NativeClass, which is a subclass of Class and uses a custom memory layout.
