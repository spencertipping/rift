Marking continuations.
It's good to know certain things about continuations (e.g. methods, basic blocks, etc). For example, if a continuation is pure (i.e. side effect-free), then it's also pure from a
garbage-collection perspective, making it transparent to escape analysis. This impacts context compression, which can be done if the overhead of context creation justifies it.
