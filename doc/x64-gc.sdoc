X86-64 garbage collection details.
When Rift starts up, the first thing it does is mmap() a region for the core image. This image is then used for both data and code. %rsp is then set to the highest available address, and it
progresses downwards towards the bottom of the region:

| ------------------------------------------------------------
  |   old generation    |    new generation    |   permgen   |
  ------------------------------------------------------------
                                               ^ initial %rsp
